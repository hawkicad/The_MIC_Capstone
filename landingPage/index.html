                The <a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic">Micronutrient Information Center (MIC)</a>
                is center at Linus Pauling Institute within Oregon State University that provides high quality
                information and research on micronutrients through their website.
                This project focused on <span class="bold">improving the user experience of the website</span>
                by understanding the current users--and ultimately implementing some solutions through code.
            </p>
            <p>
                To learn about our users and issues within the website, we conducted some cognitive walkthroughs using
                GenderMag--putting ourselves in the user's shoes-and ran some user surveys.
                Using this information we designed several prototypes for the improved website.
                <span class="bold">This also informed the design for the custom tech solution.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                One usability issue we focused on was how users seeking a definition to a key word were redirected to a
                different 'glossary' page, making the experience inconvenient.
                We developed an API to address this by storing definitions of the glossary page in a SQL database.
                Then, we made a website feature to provide definitions whenever terms were hovered over, as opposed to
                redirecting the user to the glossary page.
