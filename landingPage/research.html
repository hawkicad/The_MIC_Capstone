                    Our process involved collecting user surveys through Hotjar and examining use cases on the

                    GenderMag provides a systematic way to accomplish this and can map usability bugs to
                    a user's problem-solving style, called <span class="bold">Facets</span> to better understand why it is an issue.
                    In the below figure, we have customized the Abi persona who has fixed Facet values such as
                    Information Processing Style which refers to how Abi processes information by gathering as much
                    as possible before taking an action compared to a selective style (first promising information).

                <p>
                    Cognitive walkthroughs allow us to walk in a user's shoes, through a persona,
                    as they go through a use case (a goal) in some product.
                    The walkthrough starts by selecting a use case (some overall goal to accomplish),
                    then we form a subgoal (small goal to accomplish overall).
                    Then the walkthrough participants will answer whether they think the persona would have formed
                    this subgoal (yes/maybe/no) and mark any facets they used to reach their decision.
                    After that the participants pick actions to accomplish the subgoal using a set of
                    Pre- and Post- action questions until the subgoal or overall goal is finished.
                    Anytime someone said "maybe" or "no" that is marked as a usability bug.
                    Below is the exact wording of the questions.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Subgoal</span>:
                        Will [persona] have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="bold">Pre-Action</span>:
                            Will [persona] do this? Why?
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Post-Action</span>:
                            If [persona] does this, will they know they did the right thing and are making progress toward their goal? Why?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
